Personal tic-tac-toe (with AI) project

My first entirely autonomous Java project (i.e. without a supervisor's input)!
It consists of a graphical implementation of the famous tic-tac-toe game. I conceived and wrote myself every aspect of the code, backend to frontend (using JavaFX).
The home menu of the game allows to choose 1P mode ("Un joueur") or 2P ("Deux joueurs"), and to determine who starts playing.
I also added a Min-Max AI which can be unbeatable ("Impossible"), or kept to an easy difficulty ("Facile").
This project was the chance for me to put in application everything I learned about object-oriented programming in Java, while adding some algorithmic value through the Min-Max AI I had researched for a previous project.

Please feel free to run XO.jar and try the game !
